# Smart-Crop-Recommendation-System
Crop Recommendation system using Blended XGBoost and SVM machine learning models
## Features
- Predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions.
- Utilizes a hybrid approach combining XGBoost and SVM for accurate predictions.
- Easy-to-use interface for farmers and agricultural experts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nandithadn/Smart_Crop_Recommendation_System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Smart-Crop-Recommendation-System
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset with the required features (e.g., soil type, temperature, humidity).
2. Run the main script to get crop recommendations:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3. Follow the prompts to input your data and receive recommendations.

## Dataset
The system uses a dataset containing information about soil conditions, weather parameters, and crop yields. Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly before use.
